# Coronavirus Data Notebooks

Python notebooks that leverge public coronavirus datasets to new provide insights.

This is an experimental project. The numbers may be wrong. It should not be relied on for any decision making without additional review.

Currently includes analysis of data from:
* New York Times
* Israel Ministry of Health
* Add more! Please make a pull request with your code that loads new data and provides some insight with it.

Included demonstrations:
* An algorithm for detecting new hotspots in the USA using the NYT data, in corona_notebook.ipynb
* Predictions for average recovery times and asymptomatic cases using the Israeli data, in corona_notebook.ipynb
* An interactive map with the predicted hotspots in the USA, using the NYT data, in dashboards.ipynb
* [NEW] Correlating vaccine and hospital data, using the Israeli data, in vaccines.ipynb

Contributions welcome! Contributions can include any kind of new analysis, new datasets, making the code nicer, etc.

Basic skill is needed in the Python science stack.

Make pull requests to contribute.
